The Recipe contract manages access to important functions using a special resource called Admin. This resource ensures that only authorized accounts can perform certain key actions.

The Admin resource has two main functions. The first, addSeries, lets you create a new series. It checks that the series doesn’t already exist before creating it, which helps keep the data accurate. The second, borrowSeries, allows you to securely borrow a reference to an existing series, but only if the series already exists.

The Admin resource can also create another Admin resource using the createNewAdmin function. This means you can give someone else the ability to access and use the Admin resource in their own account. This allows for controlled sharing of administrative permissions.

When the contract is deployed, it creates an initial Admin resource and stores it in the deployer’s account. It also creates a private capability, which allows the deployer to securely access the Admin resource and use all its functions.
