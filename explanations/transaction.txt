This transaction is used to create a new series using the admin account. It begins by borrowing a reference to the Admin resource stored in the accountâ€™s storage. If the Admin resource cannot be borrowed, the transaction will terminate with an error.

Once the reference to the Admin resource is obtained, the transaction calls the addSeries function to create a new series. The function is provided with a seriesId and metadata to define the new series. After successfully adding the series, the transaction logs a confirmation message.

This process ensures that only accounts with access to the Admin resource can create new series.
